			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure with IDesign & SOLID Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Project Structure with IDesign & SOLID Foundation' task into 5 subtasks, focusing on project initialization, folder structure setup, TypeScript configuration, dependency injection implementation, and testing infrastructure.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up the entire project architecture which requires deep understanding of IDesign methodology, SOLID principles, TypeScript configuration, and dependency injection. The complexity comes from establishing the foundation that will impact all future development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement TypeORM Configuration with Repository Pattern",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement TypeORM Configuration with Repository Pattern' task into 6 subtasks, focusing on TypeORM installation and configuration, entity model creation, repository interface definition, concrete repository implementation, Unit of Work pattern, and dependency registration.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing a complex data access layer with TypeORM, SQLite integration, repository pattern, and transaction management. It's a foundational component that affects data persistence throughout the application and requires careful design to ensure SOLID principles are followed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Navigation System with Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Create Navigation System with Dashboard' task into 4 subtasks, focusing on React Navigation setup, navigation service implementation, dashboard UI development, and status indicator integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up the navigation infrastructure and creating the central dashboard UI. While React Navigation provides a solid foundation, implementing a service-based approach with proper abstraction and creating a dynamic dashboard with status indicators adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Validation Framework with Interface Segregation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Validation Framework with Interface Segregation' task into 5 subtasks, focusing on validation interfaces, common validation rules, validation orchestrator, form validator factory, and React component integration.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a reusable validation framework requires careful design of interfaces following ISP, implementation of various validation rules, and integration with React components. The complexity comes from ensuring the framework is flexible enough for all form validation needs while maintaining clean separation of concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Personal Information Form with Validation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Develop Personal Information Form with Validation' task into 4 subtasks, focusing on UserInfo model definition, form UI implementation, validation integration, and repository connection for persistence.",
			"reasoning": "This task builds on existing infrastructure (validation framework, TypeORM) to create a specific feature. The complexity is moderate as it involves implementing a form with validation, connecting to repositories, and updating status tracking, but leverages previously built components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Todo Management System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Todo Management System' task into 5 subtasks, focusing on Todo model and repository implementation, TodoViewModel development, list and form UI components, and advanced features like filtering, sorting, and swipe actions.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a complete CRUD feature with multiple screens and complex UI interactions like swipe-to-delete. It requires integration with repositories, ViewModels, and status tracking, plus implementing filtering and sorting functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Status Tracking System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Status Tracking System' task into 4 subtasks, focusing on PageStatus model definition, StatusTrackingService implementation, StatusRepository creation, and dashboard integration with React Context.",
			"reasoning": "This task creates a cross-cutting system that tracks completion status across the application. It requires careful design to ensure it can be easily integrated with all screens and properly update the dashboard. The use of React Context for global state management adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Photo Gallery with Camera Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Photo Gallery with Camera Integration' task into 6 subtasks, focusing on native camera integration, photo model and repository implementation, file system service, gallery UI, camera capture screen, and offline persistence.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex native integration with the device camera and file system, requiring permissions handling and platform-specific code. It also includes implementing a complete photo management system with capture, storage, viewing, and offline persistence capabilities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Offline Data Management",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Offline Data Management' task into 7 subtasks, focusing on SynchronizationService interface and implementation, CommandQueue development, Command pattern implementation, NetworkService, offline-first repository strategy, conflict resolution, and background synchronization.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it requires implementing a robust offline-first architecture with command queuing, network detection, conflict resolution, and background synchronization. It touches multiple parts of the application and requires careful design to handle edge cases and ensure data integrity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Testing and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Comprehensive Testing and Error Handling' task into 6 subtasks, focusing on Jest configuration, test utilities, UI component testing, service/ViewModel testing, centralized error handling, and performance monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up comprehensive testing across all application layers and implementing a robust error handling system. It requires deep knowledge of testing methodologies, mocking strategies, and error management patterns. The task touches every part of the application and is critical for ensuring quality and reliability."
