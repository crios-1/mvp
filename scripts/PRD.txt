# React Native MVVM Todo & Photo App PRD

## Overview
A React Native mobile application built with MVVM architecture that provides offline-first functionality for managing personal information, todo items, and photo collections. The app features a dashboard-based navigation system with status tracking and comprehensive form validation. The application is designed to work entirely offline with future synchronization capabilities to a web API.

**Problem it solves:** Users need a reliable, offline-capable mobile app for managing personal data, tasks, and photos without requiring constant internet connectivity.

**Target users:** Individuals who need to organize personal information, manage tasks, and store photos with offline access and eventual cloud synchronization.

**Value proposition:** Provides a seamless offline experience with robust data management, intuitive navigation, and comprehensive validation while maintaining data integrity and user experience.

## Core Features

- **How it works:** Grid-based layout with color-coded tiles that change based on page completion status

### 2. Personal Information Form
- **What it does:** Collects and validates user information with reusable validation framework
- **Why it's important:** Establishes user profile and demonstrates validation patterns for future forms
- **How it works:** Form with multiple input types, real-time validation, and TypeORM persistence

### 3. Todo Management System
- **What it does:** Create, read, update, and delete todo items with offline storage
- **Why it's important:** Core task management functionality with persistent data
- **How it works:** List-based interface with CRUD operations and local database storage

### 4. Photo Gallery with Camera Integration
- **What it does:** Capture photos using device camera and display them in a gallery format
- **Why it's important:** Multimedia content management with device integration
- **How it works:** Camera access, photo storage, and gallery display with offline persistence

### 5. Offline Data Management
- **What it does:** Ensures all data operations work without internet connectivity
- **Why it's important:** Provides reliable user experience regardless of network conditions
- **How it works:** TypeORM local database with queue system for future API synchronization

### 6. Status Tracking System
- **What it does:** Tracks completion status of each page and updates dashboard accordingly
- **Why it's important:** Provides visual feedback on user progress and app usage
- **How it works:** Status persistence with real-time dashboard updates

## User Experience

### User Personas
1. **Busy Professional:** Needs quick task management and photo organization during commutes
2. **Offline User:** Frequently works in areas with poor or no internet connectivity
3. **Data-Conscious User:** Values data integrity and comprehensive validation

### Key User Flows
1. **App Launch Flow:**
   - App starts → Dashboard loads → User sees all available sections
   - Color-coded tiles indicate completion status
   - Tap any tile to navigate to specific functionality

2. **Information Entry Flow:**
   - Navigate to Personal Info → Fill form with validation feedback
   - Save data → Status updates to "completed" → Dashboard tile changes color

3. **Todo Management Flow:**
   - Navigate to Todo List → Add/edit/delete items → All changes saved locally
   - Mark todos complete → Status updates → Dashboard reflects progress

4. **Photo Management Flow:**
   - Navigate to Photo Gallery → Take new photo or view existing
   - Photos stored locally → Gallery updates → Status tracking

### UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, intuitive dashboard with clear visual hierarchy
- Consistent form validation patterns across all input screens
- Responsive design that works across different device sizes
- Clear status indicators and completion feedback
- Offline-first design with no loading states for local operations

## Technical Architecture

### IDesign Methodology & SOLID Principles Integration

The application architecture follows IDesign methodology and SOLID principles to ensure maintainable, scalable, and testable code:

#### IDesign Methodology Components:
